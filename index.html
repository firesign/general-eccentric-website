            <p>I graduated with an MFA at <a href="http://yorku.ca/">York University</a> in 1980, then got married and took on a hobby. I learned the basics of electronics and found that I had a knack for invention. In 1984, however, I was sidetracked by the Macintosh computer and became a graphic and interaction designer. Twenty-five years later, lured by the promise of the artist-friendly &ldquo;<a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>&rdquo;, I unpacked my electronics lab.</p>
            <p>My self-directed projects can be described as &lsquo;toys&rsquo; that relate obliquely to my experience as a design educator at <a href="http://nscad.ca/">NSCAD</a>. I'm interested in technology and how it relates to our human need to shape our environments and experiences. On a deeper level, I'm intrigued by the fragility of the design process; in particular how success is bred through a cultivation of failure. My own work uses the Situationist methodology of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/detourn.htm">D&eacute;tournement</a>&rdquo;, where cultural artifacts are re-purposed as a critique of modern culture.</p>

            <p class="lobster">Where have I heard that slogan before?</p>
            <p>In the 1960's, General Electric&rsquo;s slogan was &ldquo;<a href="http://www.itjungle.com/tfh/tfh033108-story01.html">Progress is our most important product</a>&rdquo;. I remember it from watching &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Bowl">G.E&rsquo;s College Bowl</a>&rdquo;, a quiz show on US television. In 1969, however, comedian Arte Johnson mangled the phrase as &ldquo;Progress is our most important problem&rdquo; on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh-in">Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In.</a></p>

            <h2>The Work</h2>
            <p>Our culture&rsquo;s concept of innovation and creativity stems from Archimedes&rsquo; &ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo; moment. This perception colours our view of the artificial world; our structures, our products, our social and education systems are imbued with this myth of the &ldquo;Master Designer&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a great story, this Archimedes, but in reality, our world is more a product of &ldquo;oops!&rdquo; than &ldquo;eureka!&rdquo;.</p>
            <p>My work tends to situate itself at the intersection between technical virtuosity and failure. It&rsquo;s a practical investigation of the points in the creative process where rationality breaks down and new thought emerges, where the concept and original utility of the objects is annulled by a &ldquo;fatal flaw&rdquo; in concept, understanding, or execution.</p>

            <p>Sept. 24, 2012: Received invite from <a href="http://www.fosu.edu.cn/Engweb/">Foshan University</a> to conduct a workshop at the School of Design in November. I&rsquo;ll be working on a new concept for a power bar. Foshan is the third city (next to Guangzhou and Shenzhen) in the Pearl River Delta manufacturing region of China.</p>
